## Overview

This repository contains descriptions and supporting implementations for some

adopting them will enable a certain amount of interoperability and shared infrastructure
for basic tooling such as logs and witnesses.

## Formats

The following formats are described in this repository, more detailed information is
provided in the respective directories:
### Log Checkpoint

The [`log checkpoint`](./log/README.md#checkpoint-format) represents a commitment to the
state of a transparent log.
